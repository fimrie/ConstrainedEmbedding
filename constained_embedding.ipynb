    "My recent work has explored deep generative models where the goal is to design a compound that is highly similar (in a 3D sense) to either the molecule you started with or two fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have assessed 3D similarity by generating conformers of the generated molecules, and comparing them to a conformation of the original molecule/fragments via several metrics. This approach has both the advantage AND the disadvantage of the generated conformers being independent of the target conformer.\n",

    "I recently learnt about the RDKit function `AllChem.ConstrainedEmbed()`, which generates conformations where the positions of a set of atoms are constrained to match the coordinates of a template molecule.\n",
